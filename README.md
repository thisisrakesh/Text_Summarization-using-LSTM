# Text_Summarization-using-LSTM
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a model for text summarization using LSTM and Transformer architectures. Text summarization is the process of reducing a large body of text to a shorter version while retaining the key information.

In this project, two different models are implemented:

LSTM-based Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for abstractive text summarization.
Transformer model (based on the attention mechanism) for more efficient and accurate summarization.
The model is trained on a dataset of news articles, where the goal is to generate summaries of the input articles.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and converting text data into numerical form.
LSTM-based Seq2Seq: Encoder-decoder model using LSTM layers.
Transformer: Implementation of Transformer-based architecture with multi-head attention and positional encoding.
Evaluation: Rouge score is used to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries.
Deployment: The model is deployable via a Flask API or TensorFlow Serving.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training models.
NLTK/Spacy: For text preprocessing.
Hugging Face Transformers: For the Transformer model.
Rouge: For evaluation of summarization quality.

Dataset
For this project, you can use the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which consists of news articles and summaries. You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Convert the text and summaries into sequences of integers.
Padding: Ensure that all input sequences are of the same length using padding.
Vocabulary Building: Create a word-to-index and index-to-word dictionary for encoding and decoding text.
Model Architectures
1. LSTM-based Seq2Seq Model
The Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model consists of two parts:

Encoder: An LSTM that reads the input sequence and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.
Decoder: An LSTM that reads the context vector and generates the summary word by word.
Key Components:
Embedding Layer: Converts input words into dense vectors.
Bidirectional LSTM Encoder: Processes the input in both forward and backward directions.
LSTM Decoder with Attention: Generates the output summary while attending to the relevant parts of the input.
Model Summary:
python
   
# Model summary for LSTM-based Seq2Seq will be printed here in TensorFlow.
2. Transformer Model
The Transformer architecture is based on the attention mechanism and doesnâ€™t rely on recurrence, making it faster and more efficient for long sequences.

Key Components:
Positional Encoding: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence.
Multi-Head Attention: Allows the model to attend to different parts of the input simultaneously.
Feedforward Network: Processes the attended information to generate the summary.
Model Summary:
python
   
# Model summary for Transformer-based summarization will be printed here in TensorFlow.
Training
Training Process
Compile the model: Use an optimizer like Adam and a loss function like sparse categorical crossentropy.
Train the model: Feed the tokenized and padded sequences into the model.
Early Stopping: Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
python
   
# Code to compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(input_data, target_data, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)
Evaluation
The performance of the summarization models is evaluated using the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).

ROUGE Score
ROUGE is a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization by comparing the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary.

python
   
# Code to calculate ROUGE scores
from rouge import Rouge
rouge = Rouge()
scores = rouge.get_scores(generated_summaries, reference_summaries)
print(scores)
How to Use
Running the Model
You can use the trained model to generate summaries for new text data. Example:

python
   
def summarize(text):
    # Preprocess and tokenize input text
    # Generate summary using the trained model
    return summary
API Deployment (Optional)
You can deploy this model as a REST API using Flask:

python
   
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(_name_)

@app.route('/summarize', methods=['POST'])
def summarize_text():
    data = request.json
    summary = summarize(data['text'])
    return jsonify({'summary': summary})

if _name_ == '_main_':
    app.run(debug=True)
